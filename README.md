## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I do both frontend and backend development but I don't consider myself as a full stack programmer. I'm way too far from being a true full stack developer. But hey, we all are learning every day, aren't we?

- I like backend more than frontend but I feel very comfortable on both sides

- I'm currently working as a freelance developer


### Languages I'm comfortable with
- Javascript
- Typescript
- Java
- Python
- Dart

### I'm currently learning
- Machine learning with Python and Tensorflow
- I'm catching up with React after a while
- I'm catching up with Flutter 2.0
